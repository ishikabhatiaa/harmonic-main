            <p>
                Wine is more than just a drink; it's a lifestyle, a study in farming, and a way to explore different
                cultures.

                However, with so many different angles to approach wine, how do you get started?

                Fortunately, there are only a few basic techniques to learn, as well as some common wine knowledge.
                Learn the different wine styles, wine glasses, and tips on tasting like a wine connoisseur.

                        <p>Merlot is a red wine that is produced from the grape variety of the same name. Stylistically,
                            it runs the gamut from
                            fruit-forward and sweet with oak to more structured and nuanced, capable of aging for
                            decades. Merlot is one of the key
                            components in the classic blends of Bordeaux. On the Right Bank, in Pomerol in particular,
                            it is often crafted into
                            wines (or incorporated into blends, typically with Cabernet Franc) that rank among the most
                            profound in the world.</p>

                            wines are red, but can
                            also be leveraged to produce fantastic rosé (look for the Inman Family "Endless Crush" OGV

                            complex example). Pinot Noir is also one of the three main grape varieties in Champagne,

                        <p>Syrah is a wine that's produced from the grape of the same name. It's most frequently
                            crafted as a red wine, which makes
                            sense given the thicker skins, tannins, and phenolic compounds that can be extracted
                            from them during maceration and
                            fermentation. But Syrah is also an important player in the world of rosé. Examples from

                            its peak of quality and
                            expressiveness in the United States, it is almost always labeled with the name of that grape
                            on the bottle. The
                            overwhelming majority of Zinfandel wines are red, dry, and still, though rosé and sweet

                            also plays an important role in rosés. In most of the world it is referred to as Grenache
                            (or, less frequently, Grenache
                            Noir) but in Spain and other Spanish-speaking wine-producing countries, it's known as

                        <p>Malbec is a wine produced from the grape of the same name. It is most often a red wine, but
                            like all
                            other red varieties, it can be made into white and rosé. Historically, white Malbec was a
                            rarity,
                            and while it still is, there are a handful of examples notably being produced in Argentina.
                            Malbec
                            rosé is far more commonly seen, but the grape really shines most brightly as a red wine,

                        <p>Sangiovese is the most widely planted grape variety in Italy, though given the naming
                            conventions of
                            Italian wines, it's unlikely that you'll find a bottle labeled as such. Rather, you'll have
                            to know
                            beforehand that Sangiovese is the dominant grape variety in Chianti blends and the only one
                            permitted in Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Outside of Italy,
                            Sangiovese
                            has some success in parts of Australia, particularly McLaren Vale, and in Oregon, Arizona,
                            and
                            pockets of California. Sangiovese is, however, primarily grown throughout Italy.</p>

                        <p>From France’s Loire Valley to Napa Valley, Canada, Argentina, and beyond, Cabernet Franc
                            shines on
                            its own and in blends. A cooler glass of Cabernet Franc will place the focus more squarely
                            on the
                            herbal and bell pepper notes, whereas a less-cool glass will allow the brambly berries, wild
                            strawberries, and plums to emerge more assertively. In either case, the best examples will
                            showcase
