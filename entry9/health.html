            <h2>How Much Wine Should You Drink?</h2>
            <p>Moderate wine consumption varies based on gender, age, health, and wine's alcohol content. According to
                PubMed
                Central and the US Department of Health and Human Services, optimal consumption is 1 glass per day for
                women and
                2 for men. Wine's ABV is typically 12% per 5 fl. oz, higher than beer's 5% in 12 fl. oz. Stick to
                recommended
                servings and savor each sip.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What is In Red Wine that is Good for You?</h2>
            <p>Red wine, rich in antioxidants from dark-skinned grapes, combats harmful free radicals. Dark grapes, high
                in
                resveratrol, offer health benefits. Red wine's low carb content, around 2 grams per glass, contrasts
                with beer's
                10-20+ grams in 12 oz.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>What Are The Physical Benefits of Drinking Red Wine?</h2>
            <p>Red wine's moderate consumption is linked to lower heart disease risk, thanks to antioxidants. It
                improves heart
                health, increases "good" HDL cholesterol, and lowers "bad" LDL cholesterol. Resveratrol in wine also
                helps
                reduce blood pressure and manage blood sugar in diabetics.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The Benefits of Red Wine on Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Moderate red wine consumption may reduce depression and anxiety risk. Resveratrol impacts brain enzymes
                controlling stress, offering an alternative to traditional mental health medications. However, excessive
                consumption can negate these benefits.</p>

            <h2>Wine’s Distinct Aesthetic</h2>
            <p>Wine's appeal is not just health-related. It's seen as sophisticated, historically enjoyed by nobility.
                Its
                visual appeal and the picturesque vineyards where it's made add to its distinct aesthetic. The
                traditional grape
                stomping process, "pigéage," further enhances its charm.</p>
