It was first popularized in the 1920s by an Austrian philosopher name Rudolf Steiner. There are two certifying bodies for wine: Demeter International and Biodyvin. Certified biodynamic wines contain up to 100 mg/L sulfites and do not necessarily taste differently than non-biodynamic wines.</p>
        <p><strong>Biologique:</strong>  An organically produced wine.</p>
        <p><strong>Brix (symbol °Bx):</strong>  Relative density scale for sucrose dissolved in grape juice used for determining the potential alcohol level of a wine. ABV is about 55–64% of the Brix number. For example, 27°Bx will result in a dry wine with 14.9–17.3% ABV.</p>

Chaptalization is illegal in the United States but common in cool climate areas such as regions in France and Germany.</p>
        <p><strong>Château</strong>  French word for castle (aka Castello). Often used alongside the name of an estate winery.</p>
        <p><strong>Clarification and Fining</strong>  A process after fermentation where proteins and dead yeast cells are removed. To clarify, either a protein, such as casein (from milk) and egg whites or a vegan clay-based agent like bentonite or kaolin clay are added to wine. These fining agents bind to suspended particles and cause them to drop out of the wine.</p>

        <h2 id="O">O</h2>
        <p><strong>Oak: American</strong>  American white oak (Quercus alba) grows in the Eastern United States and is primarily used in the Bourbon industry. American oak is known for adding flavors of coconut, vanilla, cedar, and dill. Since American oak tends to be more loose-grained, it’s known to impart robust flavors.</p>
        <p><strong>Oak: European</strong>  European oak (Quercus robur) is sourced primarily in France and Hungary. Depending on where it is grown it can range from medium grained to very fine grained. European oak is known for adding flavors of vanilla, clove, allspice, and cedar.</p>

        <p><strong>Organic Wine</strong>  Organic wine must be made with organically grown grapes and processed using a short list of acceptable additives. EU allows organic wines to use sulfur dioxide (SO2) and US organic wines do not allow the use of SO2.</p>
        <p><strong>Oxidation / Oxidized</strong>  When wine is exposed to oxygen, a chain of chemical reactions occur that alter the compounds. One obvious change is an increased level of acetaldehyde, which smells similar to bruised apples in white wine and nail polish remover in red wines. Oxidation is the opposite of reduction.</p>


       <h2 id="P">P</h2>
       <p><strong>Phenols</strong>  A group of several hundred chemical compounds found in wine that affect the taste, color, and mouthfeel of wine. Tannin is a type of phenol called a polyphenol.</p>
       <p><strong>Produttori</strong>  Producers in Italian. Used on wine labels to describe a cooperative wine business.</p>
       <p><strong>pH</strong>  A figure that expresses the acidity or alkalinity in a substance numbered from 1–14, where 1 is acid, 14 is alkaline, and 7 is neutral. Wine’s average range is about 2.5–4.5 pH and a wine with a pH of 3 is ten times more acidic than a wine with a pH of 4.</p>
       <p><strong>Phylloxera</strong>  A microscopic louse that eats Vitis vinifera roots and kills vines. It first spread throughout Europe in the 1880s and devastated the majority of the world’s vineyards except for a few places with sandy soils (the louse cannot thrive in sand). The only solution was to graft Vitis vinifera vines onto other vine species’ rootstocks, including Vitis aestivalis, Vitis riparia, Vitis rupestris, and Vitis berlandieri (all native American species). To date, there is still no cure for grape phylloxera.</p>
       <p><strong>Poggio</strong>  Italian wine term for hill or elevated place.</p>
       <p><strong>Produttori</strong>  Producers in Italian. Used on wine labels to describe a cooperative wine business.</p


       <h2 id="Q">Q</h2>
       <p><strong>Qualitätswein</strong>  Austria's mark for quality wine. Qualitätswein wines are demarcated by a red-and-white striped bottle seal (typically found on the top of the capsule) that indicates the wine passed 2 inspections (a chemical and tasting analysis). Wines are made with 36 official grapes and labeled with one of the 16 wine regions or 9 Austrian states (e.g. Niederösterreich, Burgenland, Wien, Steiermark, etc).</p>

       <h2 id="R">R</h2>
       <p><strong>Reduction</strong>  When wine doesn’t receive enough air during fermentation, the yeast will substitute its need of nitrogen with amino acids (found in grapes). This creates sulfur compounds that can smell like rotten eggs, garlic, burnt matches, rotten cabbage, or sometimes positive traits like passionfruit or wet flint rocks. Reduction is not caused by “sulfites” being added to wine.</p>
       <p><strong>Reserva</strong>  A Spanish wine term that's used to describe a wine that's been aged for longer than the standard denomination. Aging varies from region to region.</p>
       <p><strong>Reserve</strong>  A wine label term that has many meanings depending on what country the wine is from. In the United States, Reserve is a non-regulated term. Some wineries use this term to describe a special quality level, others for marketing. In Austria, Reserve is used to describe wines made in a rich style with more than 13% ABV made with hand-harvested grapes.</p>
       <p><strong>Residual Sugar (RS)</strong>  The sugar from grapes left over in a wine after a fermentation stops. Some wines are fermented completely dry, and some are stopped before all the sugar is converted to alcohol to create a sweet wine. Residual Sugar ranges from nothing to upward of 400 grams per liter for very sweet wines.</p>
       <p><strong>Riserva</strong>  An Italian wine term that's typically used to describe a wine that's been aged for longer than the standard denomination. Aging varies from region to region.</p>

        <p><strong>Sur Lie</strong>  Meaning "on the lees" in French and used to describe resting a wine with its autolytic yeast particles that are left after the fermentation.</p>
        <p><strong>Superiore</strong>  Found on Italian wine labels and most commonly associated with a regional classification that typically have more rigorous production quality standards.</p>
        <p><strong>Sans Soufre</strong>  French term for "without sulfur." Usually on bottle labels indicating a wine with absolutely no added sulfur (but not necessarily 100% sulfite free).</p>


        <h2 id="T">T</h2>
        <p><strong>Trocken</strong>  A German and Austrian wine term for dry wines which may contain up to 9 g/L RS (depending on their level of acidity). In Germany, when Trocken is used in combination with "Selection" (and is a wine from Rheingau) it means the grapes were hand-harvested.</p>
